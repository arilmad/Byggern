# Cource Project in TTK4155 - Embedded and Industrial Computer Systems Design

This is term project in TTK4155 - Embedded and Industrial Computer Systems Design at NTNU, autumn 2019. Created by group 47, Arild Madshaven and Lars Olav Libj√•.

## Getting Started
This project is written for and around two nodes consisting of an Atmel AVR ATMega162 and an Arduino MEGA.

The goal with the term project is to make a "ping pong-machine" used to play a game. As well as learning a few things a long the way. As how to set up an UART connection with the computer, reading and writing from external ram, getting various sensor data, and implementing differnet kind of communication protocols for the nodes to communicate.
